    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm an aspiring freelance Web developer. Currently, I am learning to front-end web devlopment and maintaining a few WordPress sites for clients. Although most of my day is spent with my three boys.</p>
    <p>I love web development and constantly learning new and better ways to build on the web. As a kid, I spent quite a bit of time building thing. That love for building and creating has transfered very well into the web development projects I have completed thus far.</p>

    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I love coffee, traveling (but rarely do these days), and diy projects. If I am not brainstorming web projects or trying to teach myself programming, I am brainstorming and creating diy house projects.</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>I would love to work from home full-as a freelance web developer, building sites and web apps for designers.</p>
    <h2>What's your background?</h2>
    <p>I have dabbled in coding throughout various parts of my life. However, it wasn't until I was maintaining the WordPress site for my Pilates studio that I wanted to learn more. From there I started blogging and found that I enjoyed designing my blog and working on the back-end more than writing content and publishing posts. Everything I have learned in terms of web development has been done by googling, and taking classes online through Treehouse and in-person classes through Girl Develop It's Philadelphia chapter.</p>
